SDP3.m reproduces the method proposed in 
Y. Li and G. Wang, ``Multistatic localization with unknown transmitter position and signal propagation speed,'' \textit{IEEE Signal Process. Lett.}, vol. 29, pp. 1427--1431, 2022.

For technical details of the method, please refer to the original authorsâ€”since I am merely reproducing their workðŸ˜„

BFGS_PSO.m is our approach proposed in
G. Cheng and W. Xiong, ``A globally optimized iterative method for multistatic localization with unknown transmitter position and signal propagation speed,'' submitted to \textit{Journal of the Franklin Institute}, 2025.
